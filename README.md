# Add clear button to the list

## Note about a bug fix

In the code for this branch, the `listItems` array is not cleared and so the original items are displayed when adding new items.

There is a fix in [https://github.com/NoroffFEU/update-and-store-item-values-in-a-list/tree/clear-list-fix](this branch).
